# Final Project - Introduction to Digital Logic Systems  

This repository contains the files for the Final Project of the course **Introduction to Digital Logic Systems**, part of the Computer Science program at Dom Helder CÃ¢mara University. 
If you want to test it, download the `.circ` in the `Deploy/` folder, and run in on the Logisim software.

## Project Information  
- **Course:** Introduction to Digital Logic Systems  
- **Professor:** Ricardo Martins Ramos  
- **Due Date:** June 16, 2024, 11:59 PM  
- **Format:**  
  - A `.circ` file containing the designed circuit.  
  - A `.pdf` document detailing the project development.  
- **Author:** Project developed by **Enzo R. L. D. Ribas**.  

## Project Description  
The goal of this project is to design, implement, and validate a **5-bit signed adder/subtractor**.  

### Features  
1. **5-Bit Signed Adder/Subtractor:**  
   - Performs addition and subtraction of 5-bit binary numbers, including the sign bit.  

2. **Overflow Detection:**  
   - A dedicated output called **Overflow** indicates if an overflow occurred during the operation.  

3. **Result Display:**  
   - The result of the operation (addition or subtraction) is shown on a **7-segment display**.  

### Technical Requirements  
- Use the **Logisim** software to design the digital circuit.  
- Ensure the circuit functions correctly for all possible input combinations.  

## Repository Structure  
- `Deploy/`: Contains the `.circ` file with the circuit implemented in Logisim.  
- `Deploy/Documentation/`: Contains the `.pdf` documents detailing the project, including:  
  - Truth tables.  
  - Circuit diagrams.  
  - Explanation of the adder/subtractor functionality, overflow detection, and 7-segment display integration.  

## Conclusion  
This project consolidates fundamental concepts of digital logic systems, such as adders, subtractors, overflow detection, and integration with displays. It also provides practical experience in digital circuit modeling using simulation tools.
